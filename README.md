This will be my final website portfolio meaning I will be not updating the old/first one I made at all. This one will be continously updated with new projects as they get completed as well as my updated Resume being added to it once I make one.

This project was made with Next JS using the ChakraUI Library as well as Framer Motion for some minimal transitions and animations.
